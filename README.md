# Exploring-R
I am a student, trying to learn R through practical assignments. I think I am done enough with the basic theory required to get started. Although these assignments don't demonstrate my skills, as most of them are guided assignments, but still they teach me a lot as I make silly errors. And I hope this develops my code writing habit.
